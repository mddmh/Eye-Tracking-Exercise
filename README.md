# Eye-Tracking-Exercise

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
  This project uses javascript and CSS to display two eyes with iris that follow your mouse as it moves around the page. The main focus area was using a loop to have each iris track your mouse based on the total number of eyes you wanted to use (in this example we used 2).
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  Going forward I would like to try this with more eyes.
  Add event onclick to change the color of the iris to a random color.
